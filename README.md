# Overview

This is a repository with codes and data, basing on the manuscript “The
Central African Soil Spectral Library: A new soil infrared repository
and a geographical prediction analysis”. The material within this
repository allows to reproduce our obtained results.

  - **R**: used R scripts
  - **R/Rhelper**: used R functions
  - **data/reference\_data**: reference data for the two soil spectral
    libraries (SSL); our central African SSL called CSSL and the AfSIS
    SSL
  - **data/metadata**: metadata for the two soil spectral libraries
    (SSL); our central African SSL called CSSL and the AfSIS SSL used
    for the modeling
  - **data/spectra\_data**: spectral data for the two soil spectral
    libraries (SSL); our central African SSL called CSSL and the AfSIS
    SSL
